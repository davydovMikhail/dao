# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
TOKEN_ADDR="0x021DcD1ff412a3aDa6CA23585773b3a947E58C87"
DAO_ADDR="0x43bA1E17D81B54Cf9e4011B62263dfcd2edCC653"
TEST_ADDR="0xd7ddAEA17C978756D940c6749938638Be1Ab7957"
```
